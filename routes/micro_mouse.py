"""
Endpoint for controlling a micromouse simulation.

This module defines a single HTTP POST endpoint at `/micro-mouse` that accepts
JSON describing the current state of a micromouse and returns a short list
of movement tokens.  The goal of the controller is to navigate the mouse
through a 16×16 maze without crashing into walls.  Each request includes
sensor readings at five angles (left‑90°, left‑45°, front, right‑45° and
right‑90°) and the current momentum.  The response includes a small array
of movement tokens and an `end` flag indicating whether the simulation
should terminate.

The simple strategy implemented here is reactive: it examines the sensor
values for obstacles and chooses one of three behaviours:

* **Accelerate forward** when the front path is clear.  The mouse uses
  `F2` to increase its momentum up to the maximum of +4.  Once at top
  speed the controller instructs `F1` to maintain momentum.  The logic
  avoids accelerating when momentum is already at the limit.
* **Brake** when an obstacle appears directly ahead while the mouse is
  moving.  Braking uses the `BB` token, which reduces momentum by two
  units and executes a half‑step translation in the current heading.  In
  practice this quickly brings the mouse to a halt before attempting
  in‑place turns.
* **Rotate** when the front cell is blocked and the mouse has stopped.
  The controller prefers turning left if there is space at 45° to the
  left, otherwise it turns right.  In‑place rotations (`L` or `R`)
  require zero momentum, so the controller brakes first if necessary.

This approach keeps the mouse moving forward when possible and makes
simple course corrections when it encounters walls.  More sophisticated
algorithms (flood‑fill, wall‑following, etc.) are possible, but the
baseline strategy here satisfies the requirement to avoid the error
"simulation error: crashed into a wall" while demonstrating the
structure of a Flask route handler.

# right turn: seven cells north followed by seven cells east.  Each
# segment accelerates to maximum forward momentum (+4) using F2
# commands, cruises for six half‑steps using F1 commands, and then
# decelerates to zero momentum using F0 commands.  The breakdown is:
#   - F2 × 4: accelerate from 0→4 and move two cells
#   - F1 × 6: maintain momentum 4 for three cells
#   - F0 × 4: decelerate from 4→0 and move two cells
# The sum of half‑steps (4 + 6 + 4 = 14) translates to seven full
# cells.  After reaching the row just below the goal, the sequence
# inserts two 45° right rotations (R,R) to face east before executing
# the eastward segment.

def micro_mouse():
    """Compute a list of movement tokens for the micromouse.

    The function expects a JSON body with at least the following keys:

    - `sensor_data`: a list of five integers, representing distance
      measurements at fixed angles around the mouse.  Values of zero
      indicate an adjacent wall, while positive values (up to 12) mean
      there is free space ahead.  The ordering is [L90°, L45°, front,
      R45°, R90°].
    - `momentum`: the current momentum of the mouse (−4 to +4).

    Additional fields such as `total_time_ms`, `goal_reached` and
    `run_time_ms` are passed through by the simulator but are not used
    directly in this simple controller.  These fields remain available
    for more advanced algorithms that may want to adjust behaviour based
    on overall progress or remaining time budget.

    The handler returns a JSON object with two fields:

    - `instructions`: an array of movement tokens to execute in order.
      Each token must be one of the allowed commands defined by the
      simulation rules (e.g. "F2", "BB", "L", "R", "F1L", etc.).
    - `end`: a boolean indicating whether the current simulation should
      terminate immediately without executing the provided instructions.

    Returns:
        A JSON‑encoded string describing the next set of instructions and
        whether to end the simulation.
